------------------

There are currently 2 different methods of installing this project locally. Below you'll see both of them. The choices are either:

üî∂ __Using DockerHub to run locally (reccomended)__

üî∑ __A full local installation__


## <span style="color:orange"> Prerequisites </span>
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## <span style="color:tomato">Method 1 - Installation using premade Docker Images via DockerHub</span>

This section guides you through pulling the docker images from DockerHub and running the images locally to boot up the application on localhost.

### <span style="color:orange">Step 1: Getting the images from DockerHub</span>
1. Make sure to have opened [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on your computer (It has to be running in the background)
2. Open a local terminal window (i.e. cmd / PowerShell)
3. Run `docker pull banquished/fireguardproject-backend` to pull the backend image

4. Run `docker pull banquished/fireguardproject-frontend` to pull the frontend image
![image](https://github.com/Banquished/ADA502-FireGuard1/assets/105752308/56a2a2c7-94b7-4faa-bde7-13bdad526851)

5. Run `docker images` to show all the existing docker images on your local machine.

6. Open the Docker Dekstop Application - You should now see the images in the images folder.

7. Manually run the backend image ( `banquished/fireguardproject-backend` ) and choose the host port 8000

8. Manually run the frontend image ( `banquished/fireguardproject-frontend` ) and choose the host port 3000
![image](https://github.com/Banquished/ADA502-FireGuard1/assets/105752308/7295cefa-dac9-470a-9204-56cb4780a60b)

9. Navigate to the Containers folder to see both frontend and backend running within the same compose-stack.

10. You should now be able to open up backend on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/apicall) and frontend on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) respectively.

Congratulations, that's it! Everything should be up and running.


## <span style="color:tomato">Method 2: Local Installation</span>
Before starting step 1, make sure to have downloaded the prerequisites mentioned in the start of this file.

### <span style="color:orange">Step 1: Cloning the Repository</span>
1. Go to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Banquished/ADA502-FireGuard1) for this repository.
2. Click the "Code" button, copy the URL under "Clone with HTTPS".
3. Open a terminal on your local machine, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
4. Run `git clone https://github.com/Banquished/ADA502-FireGuard1.git`
5. `cd ADA502-FireGuard1`
6. Open VS-code via `code .`

### <span style="color:orange">Step 2: Installing & Running the project locally</span>
All of the commands below will assume a starting point from the root directory.

In order to connect the backend and the frontend locally, one has to make sure that both frontend and backend is running simultaneously.

#### <span style="color:orange">Step 2.1: Frontend</span>

```
cd .\frontend\
npm install
npm start
```

-----------------
#### <span style="color:orange">Step 2.2: Backend</span>
```
cd .\FRCM-app\
poetry install
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
-----------------

### <span style="color:orange">Step 3: Creating and running Docker Images using Docker Run or Docker-Compose</span>

#### <span style="color:orange">Step 3.1: With Docker-Compose</span>
From the root directory, simply run the following command:

`docker-compose up`

‚ùóWhen running `docker-compose up`, the frontend application needs around 10-15 minutes to boot properly. This is due to frontend running as a development server, instead of being built as a production server‚ùó

That's it! 

The frontend app should now be visible at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the backend app should be visible at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).


#### <span style="color:orange">Step 3.2.1: With Docker Run - Backend</span>
To build and run the Docker image for the Django backend, use the following commands (This assumes you are in the project directory root):
```
cd ./FRCM-app/
docker build -t backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -d backend
```
Your backend app should now be visible at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

##### <span style="color:orange">Step 3.2.2: With Docker Run - Frontend</span>
To build and run the Docker image for the React frontend, use the following commands (This assumes you are in the project directory root):
```
cd ./frontend/
docker build -t frontend .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d frontend
```

Your frontend app should now be visible at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) and [127.0.0.1:3000](https://127.0.0.1:3000).
